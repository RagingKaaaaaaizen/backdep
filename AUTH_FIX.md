# Authentication Fix Guide

## The Problem
You're getting **401 Unauthorized** errors because:
1. Frontend tries to load data (categories, items, brands) before user is logged in
2. All routes require authentication
3. No guest access for viewing basic data

## What I Fixed

### 1. Added Guest Role
- Created `Guest` role in `_helpers/role.js`
- Allows unauthenticated access to view data

### 2. Updated Authorization Middleware
- Modified `_middleware/authorize.js` to handle guest access
- Made JWT verification optional for guest routes
- Added logic to allow requests without tokens

### 3. Updated Controllers
Updated these controllers to allow guest access for viewing:
- âœ… `brand/brand.controller.js`
- âœ… `category/category.controller.js`
- âœ… `items/item.controller.js`
- âœ… `storage-location/storage-location.controller.js`

## Routes Now Allow Guest Access
- `GET /api/brands` - View all brands
- `GET /api/categories` - View all categories
- `GET /api/items` - View all items
- `GET /api/storage-locations` - View all storage locations

## Protected Routes (Still Require Login)
- `POST /api/brands` - Create brand
- `PUT /api/brands/:id` - Update brand
- `DELETE /api/brands/:id` - Delete brand
- (Same for categories, items, storage-locations)

## Expected Results
After deploying these changes:
- âœ… Frontend can load basic data without login
- âœ… Registration and login still work
- âœ… Admin functions still require authentication
- âœ… No more 401 errors for viewing data

## Deploy the Changes
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Redeploy your backend on Render
3. Test your frontend - it should now load data without 401 errors

## Test Your App
1. Go to your frontend
2. You should see data loading without login errors
3. Try registering a new account
4. After login, you should have full access

Your app should now work perfectly! ðŸš€
