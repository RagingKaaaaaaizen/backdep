# VIRTUAL Column Fix for MySQL Compatibility

## Problem
The error `❌ Database connection failed: Unknown data type: 'VIRTUAL'` occurs because your MySQL server doesn't support virtual columns, but Sequelize was trying to create them.

## Root Cause
Virtual columns were defined in:
- `accounts/account.model.js` (line 35: `isVerified` field)
- `accounts/refresh-token.model.js` (lines 12 and 16: `isExpired` and `isActive` fields)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Account Model (`accounts/account.model.js`)
- Removed `isVerified` virtual column
- Added `isVerified()` as a getter method instead
- This maintains the same functionality without using virtual columns

### 2. Fixed Refresh Token Model (`accounts/refresh-token.model.js`)
- Removed `isExpired` and `isActive` virtual columns
- Added them as getter methods instead
- Maintains the same functionality

### 3. Enhanced Database Configuration (`_helpers/db.js`)
- Added MySQL compatibility options:
  - `supportBigNumbers: true`
  - `bigNumberStrings: true`
  - `dateStrings: true`
  - `typeCast: true`
- These options help with MySQL version compatibility

### 4. Created Test Script (`test-connection.js`)
- Simple connection test to verify the fix works
- Run with: `node test-connection.js`

## Changes Made

### Before (Virtual Columns):
```javascript
isVerified: {
    type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL,
    get() { return !!(this.verified || this.passwordReset); }
}
```

### After (Getter Methods):
```javascript
getterMethods: {
    isVerified() {
        return !!(this.verified || this.passwordReset);
    }
}
```

## Benefits
1. ✅ Compatible with older MySQL versions
2. ✅ No database schema changes required
3. ✅ Same functionality maintained
4. ✅ Better performance (computed on-demand)
5. ✅ More reliable across different MySQL configurations

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the connection:
```bash
node test-connection.js
```

## Deployment
The fix is now ready for deployment. The virtual column error should be resolved, and your Railway backend should connect successfully to your MySQL database.

## Notes
- Virtual columns are a MySQL 5.7+ feature
- Your hosting provider might be using an older MySQL version
- This fix ensures compatibility across all MySQL versions
- The functionality remains exactly the same from the application perspective
