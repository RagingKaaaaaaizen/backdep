# MySQL Connection Fix Guide

## Problem
Your online MySQL database at `153.92.15.31` is not allowing connections from Render's servers. This is why you're getting "Database is not connected. Please contact support."

## Why This Happens
Most shared hosting providers (like Hostinger, GoDaddy, etc.) block external MySQL connections by default for security reasons.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Contact Your Hosting Provider (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Contact your MySQL hosting provider** (the company that hosts your MySQL database)
2. **Tell them**: "I need to enable external MySQL connections from Render.com"
3. **Ask them to**:
   - Enable remote MySQL access
   - Whitelist IP addresses (especially Render's IP ranges)
   - Check if your hosting plan allows external connections

### Solution 2: Check Your Hosting Control Panel
1. Log into your hosting control panel (cPanel, Plesk, etc.)
2. Look for "MySQL Databases" or "Remote MySQL"
3. Add `%` to the allowed hosts (this allows all IPs - less secure but works)
4. Or add specific IP ranges for Render

### Solution 3: Alternative Database Options
If your hosting provider won't allow external connections:

#### Option A: Use Render PostgreSQL (Easiest)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database
3. Update your `config.json` to use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL
4. This is the fastest solution

#### Option B: Use Railway Database
1. Go to railway.app
2. Create a new MySQL database
3. Update your connection details

#### Option C: Use PlanetScale
1. Go to planetscale.com
2. Create a free MySQL database
3. Update your connection details

## Test Your Connection
Run this command to test if your MySQL connection works:

```bash
cd "Watcha_lingan_guli_guli"
node test-mysql-connection.js
```

## Quick Fix for Now
If you want to test your app while fixing the MySQL issue, you can temporarily use Render PostgreSQL:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database
3. I'll help you update the configuration

## Your Current Configuration
Your current setup is correct:
- Host: 153.92.15.31
- User: u875409848_vilar
- Database: u875409848_vilar
- Password: 6xw;kmmXC$

The issue is that the hosting provider is blocking external connections.

## Next Steps
1. **First**: Contact your hosting provider about enabling external MySQL connections
2. **If they say no**: We'll switch to Render PostgreSQL (takes 2 minutes)
3. **Test**: Run the connection test script above
